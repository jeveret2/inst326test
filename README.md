This INST326 project will take the Ku Klux Klan data set from "Data Is Plural" and create a python file that allows the user to type in a any U.S. state and in return get a list of all the cities and chapters or "Klaverns" in a chronological order so the user can get an idea of how Klan chapters spread throughout that particular area over time.
According to the data set, "the first Klan of Reconstruction and the third Klan of the Civil Rights era were both concentrated in the Deep South, but the second Klan spread across the United States. That tells us that parts of the Klanâ€™s appeal (racism, anti-Semitism, and above all, anti-Catholicism) were widespread". This data spans from 1915 to 1940 giving users a wide range of time and data to observe.
